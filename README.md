### General information

> Back-end

I've used ts-node, express, webpack_dev_middleware and webpack_hot_middleware to provide an environment where Vue 2 runs with decorators and typescript hot reload, plus chalk to color the console message.

* webpack_hot_middleware => https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware
* chalk => https://github.com/chalk/chalk


> Front-end

I started with Webpack module bundler, Typescript to maintain the scale, Vue for an easier code, Pug Template Engine to improve HTML tag control and stylus language for a faster styling.

### How to install

* Install modules with **_yarn_** or **_npm_** install.
* npm start to run the application.
* Open your favorite browser in http://localhost:3000
